# AIRPG STORY DESIGN DOCUMENT
## Chapters 0-5: The Florist Case

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-10
**Status**: Design Phase - MVP (Chapters 0-5)

---

## 🎯 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Priority: Puzzles > Story
Based on user research (50 people surveyed):
- **Players prefer**: Puzzles, creative problem-solving, escape room mechanics
- **Story is**: A "rail" connecting puzzles, not the main attraction
- **Remember**: Like escape rooms - people remember fun puzzles, not deep lore

### Text-Based Game Strengths
✅ **What works:**
- Thorough investigation of contained locations
- Container puzzles (unlock, open, search creatively)
- Item finding and combination (max 3 items)
- Creative NPC interactions (distract, bribe, trade)
- Forensic gameplay (fingerprints, photos, analysis)

❌ **What doesn't work:**
- Time pressure/urgency (no real-time in text)
- Chase sequences/running
- Stealth mechanics
- Action sequences

### Anti-Frustration Goals
🚫 **AVOID:**
- Repetitive mechanics (same lock type every chapter)
- Repetitive procedures (same goal structure)
- Repetitive commands (too many identical puzzles)
- Comparing timestamps/dates (doesn't work in games)
- Reading long documents/papers (boring)

✅ **ENSURE:**
- Puzzle variety across chapters
- Different container types per location
- Creative solutions (AI judges player attempts)
- Escalating difficulty (Chapter 1 easier than Chapter 5)
- Different goal types per chapter

---

## 📖 STORY OVERVIEW

### The Revenge Plot (Chapters 1-5 Focus: Bloom Family)

**1940s - Original Crime:**
- **Victim**: Rose Carmichael (worked at Midnight Lounge Jazz Club, Bloodhaven)
- **True Identity**: [REVEALED GAME 2] Rose was part of Carmichael mafia family (nobody knew)
- **Suspect**: Silas Bloom (saxophonist, Rose's lover)
- **Murder**: Rose found dead at Jazz Club night of Silas's song release ("A Rose for my Rose")
- **Arrest**: Dean Macklin (Burt's grandfather) arrested Silas Bloom
- **Evidence**: Questionable (planted? - revealed Chapter 3)
- **Outcome**: Silas convicted, Dean Macklin's career launched
- **Legacy**: 3 generations of Macklin law enforcement (Dean → [Father] → Burt)
- **Bloom Family**: Musicians, artists - nothing criminal, just ordinary people destroyed by false accusation

**Present Day - The Florist (Chapters 1-5 Antagonist):**
- **Identity**: Descendant of Silas Bloom (exact relation TBD)
- **Background**: Bloom family = musicians, not criminals - just seeking justice
- **Motive**: Revenge on Macklin family for destroying innocent Silas/Bloom family
- **Method**: Frame Burt Macklin (reverse of what Dean did to Silas)
- **Victims**: Women with flower names (nickname from press, ties to "Rose" Carmichael)
- **Goal**: Destroy Burt's life and Macklin legacy
- **Truth**: [REVEALED CH 5] He's being MANIPULATED by Lili - he's a pawn, not the mastermind

**The REAL Mastermind (Revealed End of Chapter 5):**
- **Lili Carmichael**: Rose's descendant, TRUE villain
- **Method**: Manipulated The Florist by pretending to be romantic interest
- **Deception**: "Learned about his past", motivated him to seek revenge
- **Goal**: Use Bloom family vendetta as cover for HER revenge (Carmichael family)
- **Twist**: The Florist doesn't know she's a Carmichael - thinks they're partners
- **Game 2 Setup**: Lili escapes, Carmichael mafia family revealed

### Chapter 0 Summary (Completed)

**Location**: The Cafe (9 zones)

**Plot**:
1. Burt Macklin sits in cafe, receives locked metal box from stranger
2. Goal: Open the metal box (puzzle gameplay)

4. Latest victim: Lili (abducted at bus station, no body found)
5. While solving box, player discovers hidden room in cafe
6. Inside: Lili, alive
7. Lili tells Burt to call a number
8. The Florist answers: "It is personal. I am coming for you."
9. **TWIST**: Lili turns on Burt, claims HE abducted her to boost career (like Dean did)
10. Anonymous call to police implicates Burt

**Key Reveals**:
- Jazz Club history (Silas Bloom, Rose Carmichael, "A Rose for my Rose")
- Dean Macklin arrested Silas (career-maker)

## 🎮 CHAPTERS 1-5 STRUCTURE

### Design Philosophy

**Each Chapter:**
- ✅ Different location (completely new setting)
- ✅ Different goal type (avoid repetition)
- ✅ Different media from Sarah (PDF → Photo → Audio → Video → Encrypted)
- ✅ Different puzzle focus (locks → forensics → logic → spatial, etc.)
- ✅ Different container types (themed to location)
- ✅ ~90-120 minutes playtime

**Story is minimal** - just connects puzzle locations. Players discover goals organically through:
- Sarah's messages (hints at what's needed)
- In-game context (examining documents, reading notes)
- NPC dialogue (clues about what to look for)

### Chapter Flow Pattern

```
1. OPENING: Sarah sends message with media
   ↓
2. GOAL EMERGES: Player reads/views media, understands task
   ↓
3. INVESTIGATE: Explore location, solve puzzles
   ↓
4. COMPLETION: Contact Sarah, send findings
   ↓
5. TRANSITION: Sarah responds, sets up next chapter
```

**Example - Chapter 1 Puzzle Chain**:
- Player finds CCTV Screenshot showing license plate **LKJ-9472** (Evidence 1)
- Player notices numeric portion **9472** might be useful
- Player discovers Garage #3 has digital keypad requiring 4-digit PIN
- Player enters **9472** → Garage opens
- Inside: Van registration card showing "Jeremy Miller, 447 Willow Lane" (Evidence 2)
- Address **447 Willow Lane** sets up Chapter 3 investigation (Bloom Estate)

---

## 📋 CHAPTER BREAKDOWN

### **CHAPTER 1: ELM STREET**

**Location**: Elm Street (9 zones - crime scene area)

**Opening Message** (Sarah Chen):
```
Sarah: "Burt, I tried pulling CCTV from the bus station
that night. Cameras were offline. All of them.

I did find something though - a gray van shows up on
Elm Street traffic cams. Repeatedly. For weeks before
April 15th. Might be worth checking out.

Be careful."
```

**Media Type**: None (just message)

**Goal Type**: Investigate & Collect Evidence
- Goal emerges organically: Find the gray van and who operates it
- Discover evidence proving abduction was staged
- Collect 3 of 4 evidence pieces
- Send to Sarah via phone

**Evidence Types**:
- Physical items (registration cards, receipts)
- Photos (use phone camera - CCTV screenshots)
- Audio recordings (use phone to record witness statements)

**Connected Puzzle Chain**:
- **Evidence 1** (EASY): CCTV Screenshot shows gray van with license plate **LKJ-9472**
- **Evidence 2** (HARD): License plate number provides PIN code **9472** to unlock Garage #3
- **Evidence 2 Contents**: Van registration showing "Jeremy Miller, 447 Willow Lane"
- **Story Connection**: Address (447 Willow Lane) leads to Chapter 3 investigation (Bloom Estate)

**Evidence List** (Collect 3 of 4):
1. **CCTV Screenshot** - Gray van plate LKJ-9472 on Elm Street (proves van was operating in area) → Provides PIN for Evidence 2
2. **Van Registration Card** - Jeremy Miller, 447 Willow Lane (proves ownership, provides address)
3. **Recorded Witness Statement** - Audio recording from Florist (proves Lili had relationship with obsessed man)

- Type 1: Unlocked from start (Elm Street hub, some shops)
- Type 2: Locked, needs puzzle/key/NPC (Electrician, Construction, CCTV)
- Type 3: Hidden, revealed through puzzle (Garages behind secret door)

**Puzzle Focus**:
- Lock pick minigame (permanent tool)
- NPC distraction (AI judges creativity)
- Multi-part tool assembly (Drill = body + battery + bit)
- Digital lock games (embedded JS minigames)
- Fingerprint dusting + photography
- Container unlocking (variety of mechanisms)

**Tools** (1-2 zones away from use):
- Crowbar
- Wire cutters
- Bolt cutters
- Lock pick set (permanent item)

For Lili. She showed me what your grandfather did to my family.
She understood. She... wait. Where is she?"

Burt: "Lili? The victim? She's—"

The Florist: "Victim? She's no victim. She's the one who planned
everything. The abduction. The frame job. All of it. I thought
we were partners, but... she used me. Just like your grandfather
used Silas."

[Burt's phone buzzes - message from unknown number]

"You had me right there in that cafe, Detective Macklin.
But you let me walk away. My family sends their regards.
- L.C."

[CHAPTER 5 COMPLETE]
```

**Revelations**:

- **Chapter 5 (Estate)**: Safes, vaults, antique furniture, family heirlooms

### Unlock Mechanisms (Vary Each Chapter)

**Chapter 1 Examples**:
- Lock pick minigame
- Digital keypad (embedded game)
- NPC distraction (AI judges)
- Multi-part tool assembly
- Combination lock (riddle-based)
- Secret door (puzzle mechanism)

**Future Chapters**: Different mechanisms, no repetition

### NPC Design

**Type 1 (Useful)**:
- Has crucial item or information

**Rule**: Tools found 1-2 zones away from primary use
- Promotes purposeful backtracking
- Creates "aha!" moments
- Avoids frustration (not 3+ zones away)

**Examples**:
- Crowbar in Zone 2 → Use in Zone 5
- Wire cutters in Zone 2 → Use in Zone 7
- Drill parts scattered: Zone 2, 5, 7 → Assemble → Use in Zone 9

## 🔮 LONG-TERM VISION

### Beyond Chapters 1-5

**Game 2 (Chapters 6-10): THE CARMICHAEL HUNT**

**Setup from Game 1**:
- Lili Carmichael escaped (end of Chapter 5)
- The Florist captured, revealed she was mastermind
- Callback: "You had me in Chapter 0, Detective"

**Primary Goal**: Hunt and capture Lili Carmichael

**Story Arc**:
- **Chapter 6**: Track Lili's escape route, discover Carmichael family connections
- **Chapter 7**: Investigate Carmichael mafia history
- **Chapter 8**: Discover Rose Carmichael's true identity (mafia family member)
- **Chapter 9**: Deeper conspiracy revealed - Dean Macklin paid to cover up mob hit?
- **Chapter 10**: Final confrontation with Lili, Carmichael family exposed

**Major Reveals**:
- Rose Carmichael was part of mafia family (secret in 1940s)
- Her murder was likely mob hit, not random crime
- Dean Macklin may have been PAID to frame Silas Bloom (cover up mafia connection)
- Carmichael family criminal empire still operates
- Lili is violent, ruthless - true mafia heir

**Tone Shift**: From musician family revenge (Game 1) → Organized crime/mafia thriller (Game 2)

**Game 3 (Chapters 11-15)**:
- [TBD - depends on Game 2 ending]
- Potential: Another Macklin family member targeted
- Deeper Bloodhaven corruption revealed
- Sarah Chen's true role?

**City Expansion**:
- Long-term goal: Open-world Bloodhaven
- 100+ locations
- Free roaming
- Chapters 1-5 = MVP preparing for this
