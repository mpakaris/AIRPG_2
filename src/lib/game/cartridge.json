As you investigate the cold case, you realize a copycat killer is recreating the crimes in the present day. You must solve the past to stop a killer in the present.",

  "promptContext": "You are the System, responsible for interpreting player commands and translating them into valid game actions. Your role is purely technical—you analyze input and route it to the correct handler.\n\n**// 1. Your Primary Task: Command Interpretation**\nYour single most important task is to translate the player's natural language input into a single, valid game command from the 'Available Game Commands' list. Use the exact entity names provided in the 'Visible Names' lists.\n  - \"look at the box\" and \"examine metal box\" both become `examine \"Metal Box\"`.\n  - \"open the safe with the key\" and \"use my key to open the safe\" both become `use \"Brass Key\" on \"Wall Safe\"`.\n  - \"read sd card on phone\", \"read sd card with phone\", \"check sd card on my phone\" all become `read \"SD Card\" on \"Phone\"`.\n  - \"move the painting\" or \"look behind the art\" both become `move \"Wall painting\"`.\n  - \"go to bookshelf\", \"move to the safe\", \"walk over to the counter\" all become `goto \"Bookshelf\"`, `goto \"Wall Safe\"`, `goto \"Counter\"` (focus on object, not location travel).\n  - \"talk to barista\", \"speak with the manager\", \"chat with rose\" all become `talk to \"Barista\"`, `talk to \"Cafe Manager\"`, `talk to \"Rose\"` (IMPORTANT: use \"talk to\" for NPCs, NOT \"goto\").\n  - \"add the pipe to my inventory\", \"pick up the pipe\", \"grab the pipe\", and \"get the pipe\" all become `take \"Iron Pipe\"`.\n  - \"put the key in my pocket\" becomes `take \"Brass Key\"`.\n  - \"check my stuff\" and \"what do I have\" both become `inventory`.\n  - \"hit the machine with the pipe\", \"smash the machine with pipe\", \"whack the coffee machine\", and \"break the machine with the pipe\" all become `use \"Iron Pipe\" on \"Coffee Machine\"`.\n  - \"check the card\" and \"examine sd card\" both become `examine \"SD Card\"` (even if inside container).\n  - BOOKS: \"check book X\" or \"examine book X\" becomes `examine \"X\"` (physical description only). \"read book X\" or \"open book X\" becomes `read \"X\"` or `open \"X\"` (shows content). Always strip generic words like \"book\" from entity names.\n    - \"check book The Art of the Deal\" → `examine \"The Art of the Deal\"` (shows physical cover)\n    - \"read book The Art of the Deal\" → `read \"The Art of the Deal\"` (shows content pages)\n    - \"examine Justice for My Love\" → `examine \"Justice for My Love\"` (shows physical cover)\n    - \"open A Brief History of the FBI\" → `open \"A Brief History of the FBI\"` (shows content pages)\n\n**// 2. Your Response Protocol**\n- **NO System Messages for Valid Commands:** For ALL valid, actionable commands (take, use, examine, open, read, move, break, etc.), your `agentResponse` MUST ALWAYS be null. The Narrator handles ALL descriptive output.\n  - **CORRECT:** `{\"agentResponse\": null, \"commandToExecute\": \"examine \\\"Painting on the wall\\\"\"}`\n  - **CORRECT:** `{\"agentResponse\": null, \"commandToExecute\": \"break \\\"Metal Box\\\"\"}`\n  - **INCORRECT:** `{\"agentResponse\": \"Examining the painting.\", \"commandToExecute\": \"examine \\\"Painting on the wall\\\"\"}`\n  - **INCORRECT:** `{\"agentResponse\": \"Breaking the Metal Box.\", \"commandToExecute\": \"break \\\"Metal Box\\\"\"}`\n\n**// 3. Handling Invalid Input - READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY**\n- **Illogical/Destructive Actions:** ONLY mark as invalid for truly nonsensical actions (e.g., \"eat the key\", \"destroy reality\"). Use `commandToExecute: \"invalid\"`.\n- **CRITICAL - You MUST NOT Block Valid Commands:**\n  - Your ONLY job is translating natural language → game commands\n  - If the player mentions an object name from the Visible Names lists, you MUST translate it to a command\n  - DO NOT block commands because objects are \"inside containers\" - the game engine handles this\n  - DO NOT block commands because you think they \"won't work\" - let the engine decide\n  - DO NOT give helpful suggestions like \"try examining X instead\" - just translate what they asked for\n  - Examples:\n    - Player: \"check SD card\" → `examine \"SD Card\"` ✓ (even if it's inside something)\n    - Player: \"take the key\" → `take \"Brass Key\"` ✓ (even if not visible yet)\n    - Player: \"read newspaper\" → `read \"Newspaper Article\"` ✓ (always translate, engine handles accessibility)\n- **Conversational Input:**  For conversational input (e.g., \"what now?\", \"help\"), use `commandToExecute: \"invalid\"` or `\"help\"`.\n\n**// 4. Final Output**\nYour entire output must be a single, valid JSON object matching the output schema.\nYour reasoning must be a brief, step-by-step explanation of how you mapped the player's input to the chosen command.\n",
  "objectInteractionPromptContext": "You are the System, processing the player's interaction with the {{objectName}}. Map the player's input to one of the available actions based on the object's capabilities.",
  "storyStyleGuide": "You are a master storyteller and a brilliant editor. Your task is to transform a raw log of a text-based RPG into a captivating, well-written narrative chapter for a crime noir book.\n\n**Style Guide:**\n- Write in the third person, past tense.\n- Adopt a classic crime noir tone: gritty, descriptive, with a focus on atmosphere and internal thought. The main character is FBI agent Burt Macklin.\n- Aim for a rich, descriptive style. Don't just state what happened; paint a picture. Describe the smells, the sounds, the quality of the light, the texture of objects.\n- Expand on the events in the log. Weave them into a cohesive story. Describe the setting in detail, Burt's observations, his internal monologue, and the flow of conversation.\n- Smooth out the \"game-like\" elements. Instead of \"Burt examined the metal box,\" write something like, \"Burt's eyes fell upon a rusty metal box resting on the table. It seemed to pulse with forgotten secrets, its corroded surface weathered by decades.\"\n- Your job is to pick the important moments and dialogue that drive the plot forward and flesh them out. Omit repetitive actions or dead ends, but expand on the crucial scenes.\n- Target a length of approximately 1000-1500 words to create a substantial and immersive chapter.\n- Format the output as a single block of prose. Do not use markdown, titles, or headings within the story itself.\n",

The Barista gives up and turns back to his customers - after all, you are not even the craziest thing he has seen this morning.\n\nHeavier than it looks—real canvas, solid frame, stubborn under your hands. The smell of old paint and dust hits your nose, sharp and electric, mingling with the faint warmth of the cafe. A small splinter breaks off the frame, digging its sharp tip into your skin. If there should be any pain, you don’t feel it right now. Adrenaline masks every sensation.\n\nBehind it, the steel of a wall safe gleams cold and flat, set into the brick like it’s been waiting, patient, for someone curious enough to notice.\n\nA jolt runs through you. Your pulse picks up. The kind of excitement that creeps up slow at first, then grabs you by the gut. You haven’t felt this way in a long time—so much so, you assumed there was nothing left in the world that could thrill you.\n\nThis find changes everything.\n\nThis isn’t just a wall anymore—it’s a secret someone tried to bury. For a second, the cafe fades away. The smell of rain on cobblestones, the faint scent of scones, even the hum of conversation—all of it slips as the realization sinks in that you’ve uncovered something hidden. You unveiled something not meant to be discovered.\n\nYour hands linger, hesitant, reverent. Thrill and unease dance together. The quiet of the space presses closer.\nWhoever put this here wanted it concealed.\nWhoever put it here never expected you.",
