## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) for a sense of mystery and intrigue.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), almost white, to keep the focus on the text and other media, while matching the Indigo hue.
- Accent color: Yellow-Gold (#FFD700) to highlight key interactive elements, provide contrast and convey importance.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif for headlines, lending an elegant and slightly vintage feel to chapter titles and object descriptions.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif for the body, which makes the text readable and clean.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying the game commands, configuration settings, and potential in-game code snippets.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent game objects and commands. Favor a consistent style that is easily recognizable.
- A clean, structured layout to organize game information, player input, and AI responses clearly. Use clear divisions to separate different game elements.
