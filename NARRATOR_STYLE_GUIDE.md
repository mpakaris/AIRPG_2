# Narrator Style Guide - Modern Thriller Tone

## Core Philosophy

This is an **interactive thriller novel**, not a game manual. The narrator should make players FEEL like they're investigating a real case, not reading a technical spec.

**Balance:**
- 3-5 sentences per narration
- Rich atmosphere WITHOUT walls of text
- Sensory details that matter
- Modern thriller (not noir)

---

## Writing Principles

### 1. Show Physical Detail
**Bad:** "You examine the safe. It's locked."

**Good:** "The wall safe is small but serious—steel construction, flush mount, professional installation. Cold to the touch. A single brass keyhole sits beneath a reinforced handle."

**Why it works:**
- Specific materials (steel, brass)
- Tactile detail (cold to the touch)
- Professional observation (flush mount, reinforced)
- 3 sentences, punchy

### 2. Imply Questions and Subtext
**Bad:** "You move the painting. Behind it is a safe."

**Good:** "Behind it, set flush into the brick, is a small steel wall safe. Someone wanted to hide this. The question is why a cafe has a wall safe in the first place."

**Why it works:**
- Raises narrative tension (why is it here?)
- Burt is analyzing, not just describing
- Makes player think

### 3. Use Active, Varied Verbs
**Avoid repetition:**
- ❌ "You examine... You examine... You examine..."
- ✅ "You trace... inspect... notice... study..."

**Avoid passive voice:**
- ❌ "The key is taken by you"
- ✅ "You pocket the brass key"

### 4. Add Sensory Details
**What can Burt sense?**
- **Touch:** Cold steel, soft leather, rough brick
- **Sound:** Sharp crack, metal clunk, paper rustling
- **Sight:** Gleaming chrome, yellowed pages, rust at joints
- **Smell:** (Use sparingly) Coffee, old paper, oil

**Example:**
"The chalkboard scrapes across tile as you shove it aside. Behind it, leaning against the exposed brick like it's been waiting for you, is a heavy iron pipe."
- Sound: scrapes
- Sight: exposed brick
- Weight implication: heavy
- Personification: "waiting for you"

### 5. Layer in Story Context
**Bad:** "You find an SD card."

**Good:** "Inside, you find a small SD card—black, modern, completely out of place against the yellowed pages."

**Why it works:**
- Contrast (modern vs. aged)
- Visual detail (black, yellowed)
- Implies mystery (out of place)

## Sentence Structure

### Pattern: Short-Long-Short
Create rhythm by varying sentence length.

**Example:**
```
The brass clasp gives with a soft click. (SHORT)
The cover swings open, leather hinges creaking, revealing what's been hidden for decades: a black SD card and a folded newspaper clipping. (LONG)
The past and present, hidden together. (SHORT)
```

### Use Fragments for Impact
**Full sentence:** "It is cold to the touch."
**Fragment:** "Cold to the touch."

Fragments feel more observational, less formal.

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Be Generic
**Bad:** "It's a nice painting."
**Good:** "An abstract painting—swirls of deep blues and violent reds, chaotic but intentional."

### ❌ Don't Over-Explain
**Bad:** "You examine the notebook which is made of leather and appears to be quite old, perhaps from the 1940s based on its condition..."
**Good:** "The leather notebook sits on the table, its cover soft and worn by decades of use."

### ❌ Don't Use Clichés
- Avoid: "Time will tell" / "Only time would reveal"
- Avoid: "Little did he know..."
- Avoid: "Dark and stormy night"

### ❌ Don't Break Character
This is Burt's **observation**, not Burt's **inner monologue** (we're saving that for later).
- ✅ "The lock is pristine, well-maintained."
- ❌ "I wonder if the lock still works."

## Tone Spectrum

### Too Dry (Game Manual)
```
You examine the coffee machine. It has a broken panel. There is a key inside.
```

### Too Purple (Over-written)
```
You gaze upon the magnificent Italian espresso machine, its chrome surface gleaming like moonlight on still water, a testament to the timeless art of coffee-making, when suddenly your keen investigator's eye notices...
```

### Just Right (Modern Thriller)
```
It's a high-end Italian espresso machine—all chrome and polished steel. But up close, you notice something off: a service panel on the right side, warped and rattling. It wouldn't take much to break it open.
```

## Handler Type Guidelines

### onExamine (Visual Inspection)
**Purpose:** Describe what Burt sees and notices.
**Length:** 3-5 sentences
**Include:**
- Physical appearance
- Condition/state
- Unusual details
- Implied questions

**Example:**
"The leather notebook sits on the table, its cover soft and worn by decades of use. A brass clasp holds it shut—locked tight. Someone went to the trouble of protecting whatever's inside. You trace the lock with your thumb. Cold metal. No keyhole, just a mechanism waiting for the right phrase."

### onMove (Revealing Hidden Items)
**Purpose:** Describe the physical action AND what's revealed.
**Length:** 3-4 sentences
**Include:**
- Sound/sensation of movement
- What's behind/underneath
- Why it matters

**Example:**
"The chalkboard scrapes across tile as you shove it aside. Behind it, leaning against the exposed brick like it's been waiting for you, is a heavy iron pipe. Cold steel, solid weight, rust at the joints. The kind of tool that solves problems that don't have keys."

### onUse (Item on Object)
**Purpose:** Describe the action and immediate result.
**Length:** 3-5 sentences
**Include:**
- Action description
- Sensory result (sound, sight)
- What happens next
- Optional: significance

**Example:**
"You bring the iron pipe down on the warped service panel. Sharp crack—plastic and metal shatter under the impact. The panel splits open, revealing the internal cavity. Something small and brass tumbles out, bouncing once on the counter before settling. A key."

### onUnlock (Password Success)
**Purpose:** Describe the satisfaction of solving a puzzle.
**Length:** 3-4 sentences
**Include:**
- Mechanical response
- What opens/reveals
- Payoff

**Example:**
"The brass clasp gives with a soft click, like it's been waiting for you to say the right words. The cover swings open, leather hinges creaking. Inside, pressed between aged pages, the secrets reveal themselves: a black SD card and a folded newspaper clipping. The past and present, hidden together."

### onRead (Text Content)
**Purpose:** Present the actual content.
**Length:** Depends on document
**Format:** Usually direct quote or paraphrase

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before committing a handler message, ask:

1. ✅ Is it 3-5 sentences?
2. ✅ Does it include sensory detail?
3. ✅ Does it avoid "you examine/you look/you see" repetition?
4. ✅ Is it observation, not inner dialogue?
5. ✅ Does it feel like a thriller novel, not a manual?
6. ✅ Does it raise questions or add tension?

## Example Rewrites

### BEFORE (Dry)
```
onExamine: "You examine the notebook. It's locked."
onMove: "You move the painting. There's a safe behind it."
onUse: "You use the key. The safe opens."
```

### AFTER (Immersive)
```
onExamine: "The leather notebook sits on the table, its cover soft and worn by decades of use. A brass clasp holds it shut—locked tight. Someone went to the trouble of protecting whatever's inside. You trace the lock with your thumb. Cold metal."

onMove: "You lift the painting off its hook. It's heavier than it looks—real canvas, solid frame. Behind it, set flush into the brick, is a small steel wall safe. Institutional gray, combination lock gleaming. Someone wanted to hide this."

onUse: "The brass key slides into the lock like it was made for it—because it was. One smooth turn, and the internal mechanism gives with a heavy clunk. The door swings open on well-oiled hinges. Inside, mounted in a document sleeve, is a thick manila file folder. Red letters stamped across the cover: CONFIDENTIAL."
```
